    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

If you are interested in creating a mockup image like the ones from the personal projects section, I recommend [Genmoo](https://gemoo.com/tools/browser-mockup-generator/). This website lets you generate sleek looking browser mockups for free.

## Deployment

You can choose your preferred service (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Render](https://render.com/), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below for a production deploy.

1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**

    Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

2. **Configure `package.json`**

    Edit the following properties in your `package.json` file:

    ```json
    {
        "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
        "scripts": {
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your GitHub repository.

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

    Run the following command to deploy your app:

    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

4. **Access Your Deployed App**

    After successfully deploying, you can access your app at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`.
